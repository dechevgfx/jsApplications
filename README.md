# jsApplications

In the course "JS Applications" I learned what HTTP requests are and how to use them. I learned about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async/await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course, we created a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned from previous lectures. We learned about the architecture of an application and how to properly structure my applications.
